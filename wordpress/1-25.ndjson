In this case, it’s clear that the authors of the bill define violence as a destructive act against an inanimate object such as a pipeline, a piece of equipment, a vehicle, etc. However, as many writers have pointed out – from Bertol Brecht to Vicky Osterweil – this definition of violence is used purely to mask the violence of the state, and instead cast the resistance to that violence as an affront to the peaceful and well-lubricated machinations of a self-proclaimed democratic system.

Yes, this country has a shit education system that at best seeks to turn out unquestioning proles and at worst creates monsters who crusade in the name of the empire and its almighty dollar. But while there are those who admirably work to reform an entire education system, we can do much besides. I know plenty of folks who are products of some of the worst public school systems in the country who are avid truth tellers, readers and seekers. Our work then should be focused on inspiring people to question what they hear – to dig beyond headlines, catchy click bait, and engaging blogs that suggest this skin color is better than that. I would also say a requisite companion is building community – sharing stories outside the confines of what corporate media spews, digging up censored stories – the good and the bad – discussing them and detailing why this is dumb, why that is not, why that is fact, why that is not, etc. In these spaces, we also learn from each other – debunking by connecting – creating fertile ground for grassroots power instead of neoliberal isolation.","_key":"6894aebbeaa60"}],"_key":"6894aebbeaa6"},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"In short, the best defense against fascism we have is not censorship, it is critical thought.
