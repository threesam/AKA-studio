Who does this protect? Who gains? Activist comedian Lee Camp is censored precisely because he punches up – at the system itself – rather than punching down at poor people, immigrants, women, LGBTQ, etc. This censorship protects the state – just like the banning of antiwar or anti-police Facebook pages like Police The Police, Free Thought Project, and Anti-War.com. Those who gain are the ones already in power, the oppressors. As a part of the power dynamics consideration, we must also look at the goal of the speech. For instance, the goal of fascists who threaten me and those in my community is to do us harm based on our very existence. My goal as an antifascist is to protect my community by any means necessary, including self defense against the ideas of fascism, and those who defend them. In other words, is your goal violence or self defense?","_key":"4f106869c4810"}],"_key":"4f106869c481"},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","_key":"9ca6e955b54a0","text":"","marks":[]}],"_key":"9ca6e955b54a"},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","_key":"b09ec4d711ec0","text":"","marks":[]}],"_key":"b09ec4d711ec"},{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@https://res.cloudinary.com/dajpxzx0d/images/w_960,h_525/v1607688408/2017-03-07-1488883371-6600321-no_platform_fsur/2017-03-07-1488883371-6600321-no_platform_fsur.jpg","_key":"e3210942044d"},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","_key":"59f754b648810","text":"","marks":[]}],"_key":"59f754b64881"},{"_type":"block","markDefs":[{"_key":"ecc05bca2e39","_type":"link","href":"https://twitter.com/ajamubaraka/status/1326623412098306048"}],"style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"These questions of power dynamics and goals leads to that final point of the free speech argument: the public sphere.
