In this case, it’s clear that the authors of the bill define violence as a destructive act against an inanimate object such as a pipeline, a piece of equipment, a vehicle, etc. However, as many writers have pointed out – from Bertol Brecht to Vicky Osterweil – this definition of violence is used purely to mask the violence of the state, and instead cast the resistance to that violence as an affront to the peaceful and well-lubricated machinations of a self-proclaimed democratic system.
